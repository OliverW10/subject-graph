Use cases to try serve:
- What do i have to do to get to this elective
- What does this elective unlock for me
Others which are too large for now:
- What other subjects are there that are similar to X
- Do these choices meet my degree requirements

Some prerequsites are not simple 'A and B and C', they can be things like A and (B or C) which I will attempt to parse
Some prereqs can also contain other things such as '94 Credit points in MAJ1234' which will be ignored
Some of the prereqs are also not links to that subjects page in the handbook so cant rely on <a>'s to find them

will simplify prereqs into a list of required (and'd together) and options (or'd together) and will then render options with a dashed/lighter edge in the graph

can also get a more machine readable form from https://studentforms.uts.edu.au/evop/access/search.cfm?subjectcode=32998

how to layout graph?

degree viewer to preselect subjects and show possible electives
- to handle properly would have to use handbook archive to get the degree from the year of enrollment
